# wallpapers

Here I store the wallpapers that I like. It's not much because I don't switch wallpapers that often. Most of them I saved just because are cool, not because I actually use them.

## Installation

Don't forget to use `--depth 1` when cloning the repository. This ensures that only the most recent state of the repository will be downloaded, ignoring all the old commits.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/marcosdly/wallpapers
```

## License

As the files in this repo are images that I didn't created, I can't use something like the MIT License because I'm not sure if the original creators would allow you or me to modify anything on the images. With that being said, download them to personal use only and don't change anything.
